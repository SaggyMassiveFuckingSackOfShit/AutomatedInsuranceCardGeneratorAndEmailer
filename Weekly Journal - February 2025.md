**Weekly Journal - February 2025**

**Week 3 (February 18 - 21, 2025)**  
February 18: We had an orientation where we discussed the objectives and scope of our project. The session covered the overall vision, key functionalities, and expected outcomes of the automation-generated card system.

February 19 - 21: We focused on studying the workflow and processes required for the system. This included analyzing the steps involved in generating insurance cards, identifying manual bottlenecks, and brainstorming possible automation solutions. We explored different tools and technologies, ensuring that our approach would be efficient and scalable.

**Week 4 (February 24 - 28, 2025)**  
February 24: We started the development of the automation card system. The initial phase involved setting up the project environment, defining data structures, and integrating essential libraries and frameworks. We also began working on extracting necessary data from the Excel file to be used in the card generation process.

February 25 - Today (February 28): We continued enhancing the system. This involved refining the Python-based image generation, improving the DOCX modification process, and streamlining the conversion to PDF. We focused on optimizing performance, debugging errors, and ensuring smooth integration with our php and python. Additionally, we worked on improving the image-to-text extraction system for better accuracy.

Moving forward, our goal is to finalize the automation process, conduct thorough testing, and prepare for deployment.
